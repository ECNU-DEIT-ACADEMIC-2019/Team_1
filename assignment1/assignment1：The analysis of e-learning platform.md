# 5.The experience：
<br/>
Our group have chosen a platform that named “网易云课堂”,which is specially used to teach the people to learn something they like.
Today I will tell you the process of using this platform. Firstly, you need to register an account, link it with a phone and log in.
A new web will appear with some buttons, such as language learning, creative design, AI, product and operation and so on. What makes me 
love it is that there are so many branches under the buttons so that u can absolutely choose a field you really interested. 
Secondly, please choose what do you want to learn. After doing that, the web will display the videos on your choice which will tell you
how to gain or improve the ability you truly want to possess depend. And then you can click the video and there will be a summarize about
this video. You can know something about this lecture and finally decide whether to learn it. Of course, you can talk with someone who
is also interested in this lesson on the forum if you have some problems because it bases on the net that is very convenient to communicate.
Finally, I argue that the most important thing is that you can learn the lessons for many times if you can not catch the point.
