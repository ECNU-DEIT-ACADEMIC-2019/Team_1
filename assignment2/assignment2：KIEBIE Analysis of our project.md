* campus safety education
* traffic safety education
* fire safety education

## Environment
Because our group wants to do a safety education website for primary and middle school students, so for the applicable object of the website -- primary and middle school students, the main environment is the online environment.On the other hand, after learning online, students will mainly apply it in real life and interact with the environment, which includes human interaction and human-computer interaction.

### skill：

* Through the establishment of scenarios, learners can learn how to act and deal with potential dangers in some situations.

### attitude：

* Learners are more in awe of and grateful for the nature, the awareness of environmental protection has been improved, pay more attention to early warning signals, etc. 
* Improve the life safety awareness of learners; 
* Learners more abide by laws and regulations, Improve learners' social skills, etc. 
* Learners pay more attention to health; 
* Improve network ethics, network security awareness; 
* Learners can put adolescent emotional problems in perspective.

## Interact object
* Human-human interaction（including students-students & students-teachers）
* Human-machine interaction（including interactive videos，pictures and so on）

## Interaction

* between the learner and the learning video
* between the teacher and learners
* the learning scenario asks learner to choose 
* the learners' communication in the platform

## Behavior
In the study of safety education platform, students' learning behavior is mainly reflected in the following aspects:
* Interaction between students and the platform. Through learning on the platform, on the one hand, students can enhance their safety awareness and on the other hand, improve their self-protection ability.
* Transformation and adaptation of knowledge. Students learn relevant safety knowledge through the platform and will transform it into some means to protect themselves according to their actual situation.

## Experience
* the safety is quietly important to the young children. So we can use this platform to enhance the awareness of safety. I think it is very easy to use this platform.
* Firstly you need to sign up an account(the parents and teachers can help the children do this thing),and there will be a lot of columns that about different types of the safety after logging in.
* Secondly, you can choose a column you want the children to learn and a Flash will appear after clicking the button. What will display on the screen is that there is a girl will face to some dangerous (we have designed some stories) and the platform will give two choices that the children need to choose. And the outcome will be different depend on what the children have chosen. If they chose a wrong one, the platform will display the bad consequence-the girl got into troubles and tell them how to deal with this problems, but if they chose the right one, they will facilitate the girl to achieve her goals.
* The platform aim to help children construct the knowledge by the virtual reality. Let them react to the situation to build a right framework about safety.
